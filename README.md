# GiveSomeMoney

This is a sample code, I tried qrcode library to generate qr code... later I'll modify it to generate unique QR for each user... so that I'll be able to identify the user that made the payment and reflect it on the dashboard immediately.

You are free to use this code snippet, idc, I also generated it using chatgpt.

I am doing this so that I can use it to integrate paymants in my future projects.
